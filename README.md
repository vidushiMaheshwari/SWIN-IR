# SWIN-IR
Transfer learning on DeepLesion dataset using SWIN-IR model for image superresolution

I would try to keep this repository structured, but it is a scratch directory mainly created for myself to keep my work clean.
If you find anything interesting/ want to discuss about the topics in the repository, feel free to reach out :)

The Deeplesion dataset has 16-bit grayscale png images, which itself imposes a good enough challenge
